  Milk should be put before cereal

<h1 class="bigger"> Claim #1 </h1>

<p> When pouring milk on top of cereal, the cereal gets soggy quickly. "Milk-first people think that pouring the milk over the cereal leads to immediate sogginess, but with pouring the cereal over the milk, the cereal can float on the milk rather than being submerged in it" (Chomos 010). Personally, I agree with this statement because why would anyone want to have their firsy bite of cereal be soggy, or not crunchy? </p>

  <h1 class="bigger"> Claim #2 </h1>
  <p> When the milk is poured first, this ensure that the milk stays fresh. "Fresh" meaning there is no cereal flavoring seeping into the milk. Over time, the milk will begin to gain flavor. On the other hand, some people enjoy having their milk immediately soak up the flavor of the cereal. </p>

       <h1 class="bigger">Claim #3</h1>

<p> "If I pour the milk first, then the amount of cereal I will eat depends on the amount of milk that I poured if I want to obtain the right ratio.  Since the cereal is the more substantial component of the breakfast soup, I prefer that the cereal is the independent variable and that the milk in the dependent variable" (Chomos 010). When milk is poured first, the ratio to milk and cereal will be poured perfectly. If cereal is put first, you can't see the amount of milk (meaning it can be soggy, or dry). Whereas other cereal-first parties declare that when they put cereal first, you will never need to re-pour extra milk. </p>

 <h1 class="bigger">Overall...</h1>

<p> Cereal-first people should consider trying out the milk-first method, and vise versa. People are entitled to their own opinion, so whatever method works best for you; stick with it.
